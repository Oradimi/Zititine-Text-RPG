# Zititine-Text-RPG
This is an old high school CS project in groups of 3 people.
It was conducted for several months, and a mark was given out and counted for the finals.
The presentation at the end was individual, and I got 85%.
It currently has severe balancing issues, and some questionable code decisions, but it works.
It was a ton of fun to make, so it may receive updates in the future.
The game is currently only in french, I'll add english in the nearest update.
